# Work Day Scheduler 

## Third Party API's Challenge

## Description

This application was made for module 5, using third party APIs to build a functioning work day scheduler. Using JQuery, Bootstrap and Moment.js, the scheduler creates a table of typical work day hours and allows the user to save tasks within each hour while also displaying along with the current time, whether said task is in the present, past or future. Saved tasks will also be saved to the users local storage on their machine.

## Table of Contents
